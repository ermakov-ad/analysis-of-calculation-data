data analysis of numerical calculation of air (or liquid) flow parameters;
1. read_plt - main programm with the used functions and some their version like other arguments and returns;
2. system_parameters - some information about system like posteriory Reynolds and Rossby numbers, full kinetic energy, characteristic wavelenghts;
3. Amplitude_(theta_frequency) - picture with dependence inertial waves on frequency and angle of wave vector in spherial coordinate;
4. other files - examples of the result of the program in different versions from different functions
